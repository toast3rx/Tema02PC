Octave Simulator

This application simulates Octave behaviour in working with 2D arrays
It reads a character from keyboard and based on a set of values,
 it runs a certain command.
The arrays are stored in a resizable list and their dimensions in a 2D array where
 every line correspons to a matrix, first column representing
 the number of rows and the second column, the number of columns for that matrix.

1. Matrix Allocation (L command)
	* Takes from user input number of rows and columns
		and then (rows * columns) elements. 
	* The array is added in the list of arrays and if it's not enough space
		the list will have double the initial size.
2. Print matrix dimensions (D command)
	* It will be printed on the terminal the number of rows and columns 
		of matrix at a certain index given by the user.
3. Print 2D array (P command)
	* Print in the terminal an array at a certain index given by the user.
4. Octave Matrix Resize (C command)
	* The user inserts an index for a matrix and then the new number of rows
		the matrix will have. Will be read the index for which row will 
		remain in the aray. Same for columns. 
	* It will be created a new 2D array with the specificed rows and columns
		based on the initial array and it will replace it.
5. Matrix multiplication (M command)
	* The user will insert two indexes that represents the matrices to be 
		multiplied.
	* The resulted matrix will be added at the end of the list.
6. Sort arrays based on elements sum (O command)
	*
